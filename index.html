            <p class="our-para">We are thinking of helping the people in danger this year with some of our hard earned
                money.
                We have decided from that thought stream that we give them food, money and education this will help them
                to recover.</p>

                <h1>Food for a family</h1>
                <p>Food helps a person survive. The first thing that happens to a person during a disaster is lack of
                    water& food In that case a family is in more trouble. So we need to be humane in this regard.</p>

            <div class="shadow-shelter">
                <h1>shelter for a family</h1>
                <p>We need to help people when they are homeless due to various natural disasters at different times. We
                    must at that time gather strength from their side to deal with their disaster. We can build them a
                    house or help them build a house.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="shadow-education">
                <h1>Education for a child</h1>
                <p>Schools and colleges in the area are also closed due to the danger when there is no security in
                    people's lives. That is why children and education in the region are at stake. Then we should help
                    rebuild the school, college and primary school in the area in the aftermath of the disaster.</p>
